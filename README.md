# Scarlett Framework
Scarlett Framework - html start kit for quick development sites. MODX Revolution friendly.
This is not bootstap clone or any grid system. This is set of ready solutions for typical tasks that often arise in development of landing pages and classical sites with unique start page. At least in my practice. I use it with MOX Revo. You can combine Scarlett with Bootstrap or Foundation, neither conflicts exists.

# Structure
* index.html - just pre-made typical elements header, menu, slider, footer etc. And infinity ajax scroll preset. 
* style.css - preset, like normailize, but contains only really important things and some code for default Scarlett design.
* newstyle.scss - main SCSS file with mixins and media queries for faster creating adaptive markup.
* script.js - jQuery initial and typical JS code for sendform, main menu and other features.

# Used libraries
jQuery, Remodal, Maskedinput, Slick slider, Animated, Wow, Hover
